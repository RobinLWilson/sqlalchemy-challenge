# sqlalchemy-challenge

The first half of this challenge does an analysis of the precipitation and precipitation observations of the weather station in Hawaii with the greatest number of observations.

The first part of the second half of the challenge creates an API that queries the precipitation data in Hawaii, the precipitation observations made by the weather station with the greatest number of observations.

The second part of the second half creates a dynamic API where the user can enter either a start date or start & end dates into the URL to query date specific information.
